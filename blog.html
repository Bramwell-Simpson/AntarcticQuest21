            <h1 class="black title u-text-center">Antarctic Quest 21 Launch Event</h1>
            <p>
                We were delighted to welcome our Patrons, Sponsors and Supporters to our pre-departure event onboard the HQS WELLINGTON, on the Thames, last night.  It was absolutely wonderful to be able to provide some small measure of thanks to all those that have supported us by providing an insight into the expedition and our plans.  General Richard Nugee, the Non-Executive Director for Climate Change & Sustainability for the MOD, started off the presentation by explaining the Expeditions importance from a perspective of the UK leading on Climate Change and Sustainability.  Of great importance to the Expedition Team was a letter of support from the Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir Nick Carter GCB CBE DSO ADC, who quoted Shackleton’s own words about the Expedition, saying “To be brave cheerily, to be patient with a glad heart, to stand the agonies of thirst with laughter and song, to walk beside death for months and never be sad - that’s the spirit that makes courage worth having”. General Sir Nick also said that the Expedition would be an inspiration to future generations of scientists and explorers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, the Hon. Alexandra Shackleton, explained to the audience how the Expedition was following fully in the Spirit of her Grandfather, Sir Ernest Shackleton and his involvement in the Heroic Age of Polar Exploration. She highlighted the Expedition team are truly  stepping into the unknown to further the bounds of understanding and knowledge about Antarctica, just as her Grandfather had 100 years ago. She highlighted the fact that the Expedition Team are a private expedition, without any formal government or institutional support and with nothing more that private backing to make this happen, and this was exactly as it had been with her Grandfather.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thereafter, the Expedition Leader, Paul Hart gave a brief insight of what it is like to operate on the Antarctic Peninsula, with some hair-raising videos of the conditions the team will face. This was followed by a superb explanation of the science programme of the expedition by the Expedition Science Coordinator, Dr Charlotte Braungardt. Dr Braungardt was able to put the extremely complex issues relating to our impact on Antarctica, into a totally understandable format that enabled the audience to appreciate how every individual can take action to reduce their own input into the negative effects we are having. The presentation then moved on to our Educational Outreach programme, which was led by the Expedition Deputy Leader, Dr Antony Jinman.  Antony vitalised the crowd with his message about his own inspirational journey to becoming a Polar Explorer and how he works tirelessly to create the same opportunities for today’s school populations. The formal presentation then ended with a brief by our Expedition Doctor, Alex Cross, and the CEO of BetterYou Ltd, Mr Andy Thomas, on how we will be supported by BetterYou Ltd products, to maintain our peak physical and mental performance on the ice.  Finally, there was an auction of items, of which our great friends at Elliot-Brown Watches contributed one of a limited edition of their prestigious watches, which alone raised a four figure sum for the expedition.  The Expedition Team were completely overwhelmed by the level of support and sheer good will that was evidenced by the audience, as they provided additional financial support to allow an enduring legacy of Antarctic learning to be delivered through the Expeditions Educational Outreach Programme.  As an Expedition, we remain so deeply indebted to our partners and supporters that it is hard to provide words that describe our appreciation. We can only ask, that our efforts to provide a valuable contribution to the understanding of what is happening in the pristine environment of Antarctica and how we can minimise our impact, is sufficient to justify that psychological investment in us.

            <h1 class="black title u-text-center">Carbon footprint of our Equipment Transport</h1>
            <p>
                The carbon footprint of long-distance transport of cargo varies considerably between modes of transport. For example, the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e) of 1 tonne cargo transported between London and Glasgow by rail is 11 kg, by road is 78 kg and by cargo aeroplane is 298 kg (calculated with <a href="https://www.carboncare.org/en/co2-emissions-calculator.html" target="_blank">CarbonCare</a>). 
            </p>
            <p>
                We minimised the carbon footprint of transporting the expedition equipment and food to Antarctica with the support of the company <a href="https://polar-latitudes.com/" target="_blank">Polar Latitude</a>, who agreed to allow us to store our kit, packed in dozens of barrels, on deck of their vessel MS SeaVenture. SeaVenture makes her way from Bremerhaven, Germany to Ushuaia, Argentina and then to the Antarctic Peninsula as part of her annual cruise plan. Nevertheless, we treated this in the same way as cargo shipped by a commercial container ship. To meet the ship, the equipment was driven by two team members from the Southwest England to Germany, a distance of around 1400 km. It will be returned via the same route.
            </p>
            <p>
                The carbon footprint was estimated using the <a href="https://www.carboncare.org/en/co2-emissions-calculator.html" target="_blank">CarbonCare CO<sub>2</sub> calculator</a>, which is based on the EU EN16258 standard and reported here as ‘Well-to-Wheel’ CO<sub>2</sub>e values, meaning that the total energy required and greenhousegas (GHG) emissions from the oil well to burning of the fuel in the vehicle or vessel are accounted for. Details can be found <a href="https://www.carboncare.org/en/co2-emissions-calculator/co2-calculator-methodology.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Calculations, which include an element of extrapolation for routes not listed in the CarbonCare calculator resulted in a <strong>total of 560 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e</strong> for the return voyage of our expedition equipment. This may be a slight over-estimation, as we won’t be returning much of the food. Three elements were included one-way:
                Road Travel from Southwest England to Bremerhaven by small van: around 1400 km and 195 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e Ferry from Dover to Calais: around 100 km and 1 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e
            </p>
            <p>
                Sea Cargo from Bremerhaven, Germany to Ushuaia, Argentina and on to the Antarctic Peninsula: around 17000 km and 84 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e.
            </p>
            <p>
                To put our footprint of 560 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e for equipment transport into perspective, it amounts to around 5% of the footprint of the average British citizen (around 8000-12000 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e) and to 3.8% of that of the air freight from London Gatwick to Ushuaia, Argentina (27000 km return, 15000 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e).
            </p>
            <p>
                We will compensate for this footprint and report on that in due course.

            <p>
                As the polar ice sheets melt, the process is not just raising sea levels – it's also warping the underlying surface of Earth, a new study reveals, and some of the effects can be seen across thousands of miles.
            </p>
            <p>
                What's happening is that Earth's crust is rising and spreading as the weight of the ice across Greenland, Antarctica, and the Arctic Islands gets lifted. The movement isn't huge, averaging less than a millimeter a year, but it's there and it covers a lot of ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's a feedback loop happening too, because as the bedrock under the ice shifts, that in turn affects how the ice continues to melt and break away. A full understanding of how this works is essential in modeling how our world might look in the future. <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/polar-ice-melt-is-reshaping-earth-s-surface-as-well-as-pushing-up-sea-levels" target="_blank">Read More</a>

                    The paper ‘Solar radiative transfer in Antarctic blue ice: spectral considerations, subsurface enhancement, inclusions
                    and meteorites’ was published by Andrew RD Smedley, Geoffrey W Evatt, Amy Mallinson and Eleanor Harvey in the
                    scientific journal <i>The Cryosphere </i>(Volume 14, pages 789-9809) in March 2020. It is open access and you can read it

                    The article’s title may not roll of your tongue easily, but the story is intriguing: it’s a deep dive into detail and offers a
                    glimpse into the world of modelling. This story is about the behaviour of ice in sunlight and, at its core, is a puzzle
                    stone of knowledge relevant to one the most important environmental challenges of the day: climate change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At first glance, it’s all common sense: sunlight (solar radiation) arrives at the Earth’s surface and, depending on the
                    properties of that surface, it is either reflected or absorbed. Different surfaces reflect and absorb different amounts
                    of radiation. You know that from daily life: Wear a black t-shirt in the sunshine and you’ll feel the warmth of the
                    absorbed sunlight more intensely than while wearing a white, but otherwise identical, t-shirt. The glare reflecting off
                    a large snow surface has a different effect on your eyes than sunlight filtered through the canopy of a woodland in
                    full leaf. You’ll see light scattering in action when you watch the appearance of a freshly pulled pint of real ale
                    change, as tiny bubbles swirl and finally clear out of the liquid…
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it comes to understanding the processes that determine the temperature profile of ice, and therefore the way
                    ice melts and cracks, we need to go beyond common sense and consider a lot more detail.

                            Andrew and his colleagues combined the laws of physics with Monte Carlo
                            simulation to extend insights from previously developed models with a
                            broader inclusion of processes that affect ice behaviour. Monte Carlo
                            simulations are a widely used approach to simulating physical, biological
                            and economic processes that uses randomness in the generation of
                            numerical results. I will not go further into the mathematical detail here.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The model simulates photons (of which sunlight, or solar irradiance,
                            consists) that have entered the ice (i.e. they were not reflected at its
                            surface) travelling along random pathways into and through the ice. They
                            may be scattered by trapped air bubbles, absorbed by the ice or particles
                            enclosed within it, or escape the ice through its surface into the air. Figure
                            1 illustrates these ideas schematically. The purpose of the model is to
                            calculate how light travels up and down in ice and how much of the

                            By definition, a model is a simplified version of the system we are seeking to understand. The architect’s drawing of
                            a house is not the house itself, but it conveys information for the purpose of illustrating design. Equally, in the design
                            of a mathematical model, the number of processes and parameters considered, the resolution in time or space, the
                            sophistication of the algorithms used, depend on what we want to know and on what we know already.

                    To me, discovering the level of detail incorporated into the model of how sunlight interacts with ice, reinforced my respect for the art of modelling:

                                Think back to school and you’ll remember that light consists of a whole spectrum of electromagnetic
                                radiation, waves of different wavelengths. These may be in the visible range (think of a rainbow) or outside
                                the visible range, for example the ultraviolet light we tend to protect ourselves from using sun cream and
                                sunglasses. The solar irradiance that arrives at the Earth’s surface depends on the angle of the sun (solar
                                zenith angle) and its interaction with the atmosphere. Light of different wavelengths interact differently with
                                the atmosphere, including clouds, particles and vapour. The model uses parameters for solar irradiance
                                spectra measured near a mountain range in Antarctica for both, diffuse and direct sunlight.

                                Perhaps suffice to say that a set of mathematical expressions is used to describe the optical properties of the
                                ice in relation to the wavelength of the photons being tracked through the ice, the number and size of the
                                trapped bubbles and the way they scatter and absorb photons.

                                Only one set of data seems to exist that describes the density and properties of ice bubbles in Antarctic blue
                                ice. These were used and adjusted with other data from literature to provide a more general estimate of
                                bubble number concentration and their geometry in ice with and without cracks, for use in the model. As an
                                example, one of the results presented in the paper was based on 415 bubbles of 0.4 mm diameter in each
                                cubic centimetre of ice.

                                Particles trapped within the surface ice literally fall from the sky, as part of ‘atmospheric deposition’
                                (entrained and carried by wind or snow) or meteorites, which is surprisingly common. Particles of different
                                geometries were considered, including spherical, planar and ellipsoidal (‘balls’, ‘plates’ and ‘eggs’) of less
                                than 1 mm in size. The model was also applied specifically to iron-rich meteorites of several cm across.

                            Photons.
                            <p>
                                In the model, the positions of individual photons of specific wavelengths are tracked. Where they arrive at
                                the surface of the ice at a particular angle, their reflection or entry into the ice is calculated, as well as
                                refraction. Once within the ice, photons either return to the atmosphere, are absorbed or pass below a
                                depth where they are deemed not to make a significant contribution (below 16 m ice) to ice behaviour. The
                                model uses an innovative set of calculations that determines whether, where and how a photon interacts
                                with a bubble or particle and at what point it will cease to be tracked because it left the ice or travelled
                                below 16 m depth. The record of photon position over time provides the data necessary to calculate the
                                fluxes of and number of photons at each depth.

                <p>
                    Every scientific experiment requires quality control and has limitations. Mathematical models are no different, and
                    quality assurance is undertaken in a process called validation, which compares model output data against
                    independently generated data set or empirical data, running the model repeatedly to check reproducibility and
                    tweaking individual parameters within the model to assess the model’s sensitivity and stability. In this paper that
                    was an elaborate process and let’s just summarise: the model lived up to the standard required for its purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The model calculation results confirmed some phenomena already known to science: photons with lower
                    wavelength, such as infrared, were attenuated rapidly in the surface layer of the ice, while shorter wavelength in the
                    ultraviolet and short visible range penetrated to greater depths. There were also some new findings. For example,
                    the scattering of photons by air bubbles means that eventually, some photons return to the surface, where they may

                    be undergoing internal reflection back into the ice. This means that, at any given time, there may be up to 73.5%
                    more low wavelength photons bouncing around within the ice than are supplied to the ice from the sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why is this relevant? Photons are energy and if they are absorbed by small contaminants, inclusions or heating the
                    ice itself, they contribute to the energy budget of the ice at depth and hence, the behaviour of the ice with respect
                    to cracking and melting. In addition, the model showed that particle inclusions within the ice may absorb enough
                    energy from photons to cause the surrounding ice to melt and the particle to sink within the resulting cavity. This in
                    turn, at very small scales, means that the melting of ice surrounding particles causes the released air bubbles to
                    gather in the molten cavity, and photons will be refracted in different ways at the water-air, air-ice and water-ice
                    interfaces within this cavity, with yet more consequences for the energy budget (sub-surface radiative field) within
                    the ice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although the paper concludes with an application of this work to explaining the differences between rocky and iron
                    meteorites when it comes to sinking within the ice and where they may be found, it clearly has wider implications.
                    The insights provided here show that the energy budget within surface ice needs to be re-considered in modelling of
                    ice behaviour and for direct measurements of irradiance within the ice column.
                </p>

                    If you were interested enough to read to the end, I thank you and share a final thought with you: when you next
                    hear about model predictions of global warming, sea level rise or glacial melt, think back to what you have read here
                    and reflect upon the intricate work that lies behind this specific, seemingly small contribution to the field of climate
                    change. Perhaps it will be easier to understand the large uncertainty associated with some predictions that go far
                    into the future and appreciate that each new model is constructed with the best current expertise, breaking new
                    ground, while the scientists behind it know that their effort is just one along a timeline of improvements that
                    reaches from the beginning of modelling into the future.

            <p>
                With this question, I invite you to come and learn about our expedition and meet the team that will step into untrodden territory for science and exploration, and to commemorate our Polar Hero, Sir Ernest Shackleton.
            </p>
            <p>
                The answer to the question above may seem obvious: in an age of widespread pollution and climate change, the world that children will experience, is going to be determined by the wisdom of our decisions today. It is, therefore, key that these decisions should be founded on scientific knowledge. Scientific research is fundamental to our world view and to allowing us to use innovation, and technology to deal with issues that we may have unwittingly created, that are to our detriment as a species.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sir Ernest Shackleton was one of the pioneers of scientific research in Antarctica, a region now recognised as important to global climate regulation. His scientific legacy is unfinished and often under-valued. During our expedition, we will pay tribute to Shackleton with a ceremony on the ice and honour his memory 100 years after his passing, by continuing the scientific exploration his ‘Quest’ expedition could not complete.

            <h2 class="black title u-text-center">Why Did Antarctic Explorer Ernest Shackleton Keep ‘Conking Out’?</h2>
            <p>
                Shackleton’s entire Antarctic career was marked by strange episodes of weakness, breathlessness, and other incapacitating symptoms. His near-superhuman feats coexisted, according to expedition notes, with an occasional inability to stand on his own. While his early death has been widely attributed to heart disease brought on by years of heavy smoking, Shackleton’s intermittent bouts of weakness in his youth have intrigued historians, doctors, and armchair medical detectives for decades. </p> <p>Antarctic Quest team however will do things differently. Due to the physical demands of the expedition, the deployment team will be consuming a high calorie diet, containing macro and micronutrients to support health, performance and recovery. In addition, the team will be taking supplements where needed, to avoid potential deficiencies which may lead to fatigue or any other symptoms.

                The second of our expedition videos is now available - <a href="https://www.forces.net/?videoId=6254037478001" target="_blank">https://www.forces.net/?videoId=6254037478001</a> - it is a riveting watch as it includes original footage of Shackleton and his expeditions, as well as an interview with his Granddaughter and our Patron, the Hon. Alexandra Shackleton. This is the main reason for the name of our expedition to commemorate Shackleton.

            <p>
                <a href="https://www.ecomagazine.com" target="_blank">ECO Magazine</a> – ‘ECO’ for ‘Environment Coastal & Offshore’ – reports news of ocean science, innovation, technology and exploration to an international audience of governments and policymakers, as well as professionals and NGOs within the global maritime community. For the launch of the <a href="https://www.oceandecade.org/" target="_blank">United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development</a>, it partnered with The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (<a href="https://ioc.unesco.org" target="_blank">IOC-UNESCO</a>) to publish a digital special edition showcasing initiatives, knowledge and solutions relevant to the seven Ocean Decade outcomes. These include ‘<strong>a predicted ocean</strong>’, relating to our capacity to understand ocean conditions, forecast their change and relationship to human wellbeing and livelihoods. It is this category, to which Antarctic Quest 21 will contribute and we are delighted to announce the publication of our article ‘<strong><i>What is your next step against climate change?</i></strong>‘ in the special edition on 17th May 2021.

            <h2 class="black title u-text-center">Our Footprint – Our Responsibility</h2>
            <p>
                Today, 22 April 2021, is <a href="https://www.earthday.org" target="_blank">Earth Day</a> – what a better day to take responsibility and launch our footprint audit!
            </p>
            <p>
                Collectively, humankind use the ecological resources as if we had 1.73 planets, which means that each year
                sometime in August, we exceed the Earth’s capacity to regenerate what we use or damage in terms of soil, water,
                agriculture, fisheries, forests and so on …) in one year. Anything we collectively do after this ‘<a href="https://www.overshootday.org" target="_blank">Overshoot Day</a>’ is not
                sustainable with respect to the biocapacity of our planet.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to these ecological resources, we extract natural resources, our ‘<a href="https://friendsoftheearth.uk/consumption-natural-resources" target="_blank">material footprint</a>’, the tonnage of materials extracted to generate our consumer goods (raw materials from which we derive petrochemicals, metals, fertiliser and so on…).
            </p>
            <p>
                We also generate huge amounts of waste, ranging from the obvious and very visible (e.g. domestic, food and electronic waste, sewage) to the more obscure or invisible (e.g. greenhouse gases, microfibers, pre-consumer industrial waste).
            </p>
            <p>
                The Antarctic Quest 21 team are preparing for an expedition that supports very important climate and pollution research. But we are also using resources that would have otherwise remained untouched, including
                <ul>
                    <li>energy for global communication, transport and information technology</li>
                    <li>equipment, instrumentation, specific expedition clothing and food</li>
                    <li>hosting information and education events</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The least we can do is to find out and be honest about the footprint of Antarctic Quest 21. This process will call upon the whole team for information over the next weeks and months and hopefully lead to practical actions that reduce our expedition footprint and mitigate the remainder.
            </p>
            <p>
                I fully expect that our sustainability audit will also feed into our personal lives: it will teach us all how we can reduce our everyday footprint. Overshoot Day is not someone else’s problem, and Antarctic Quest 21 leadership is about so much more than completing the scientific mission and bringing back the team safely from Antarctica. We are going to share our insights with you.
