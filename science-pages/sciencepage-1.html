                <strong>Expedition contribution:</strong> Service and upgrade instrumentation at Foyn Point
            </p>
            <p>
                The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing ice at a rate accelerated by man-made global climate warming. This ice loss is significant for communities around the globe, as it accounts for about 10% of current sea-level rise, although large uncertainties remain with such estimates <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0179-y" target="_blank">[1]</a>. Accurate measurements of present and predictions of future ice loss are challenging, as satellite measurements of ice sheet change are affected by the solid Earth’s response to ice loss. The Earth’s crust floats on the viscous mantle beneath and the solid land masses of the Antarctic are depressed into the mantle under the massive weight of ice sheets. As the ice thins, the load lightens, and the continental crust rises in a process termed isostatic rebound <a href="https://esurf.copernicus.org/articles/6/401/2018/" target="_blank">[2]</a>. In recent decades, the collapse of floating ice shelves around the Antarctic Peninsula have triggered the acceleration of glaciers unloading ice into the ocean. Following the collapse of Larsen B ice shelf in 2002, accelerated isostatic rebound has been observed at rates far-exceeding long-term trends in that area <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X14002519?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">[3]</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The determination of isostatic rebound on the Antarctic Peninsula is one of the objectives of the project UKANET, using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations deployed on rock outcrops around the Antarctic Peninsula. To this end, long-term data are transmitted in real-time from stations installed by international scientists from a range of projects. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the instruments adjacent to the former Larsen B ice shelf, at Foyn Point, has been malfunctioning for 6 years and at present, the only method of reaching it is by overland expedition. To evaluate whether the isostatic rebound, and ice loss experienced in this area following the collapse of Larsen B is sustained, diminishing or accelerating, the retrieval of data, repair and upgrade of the instrumentation at Foyn Point is now crucial. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The expedition team will manually haul some 200 kg of equipment and tools across the AP from Portal Point to Foyn Point to make this possible.</strong>

            </p>
            <p>
                Dr Selway investigates the physical properties of the Earth’s mantle and crust with a range of geophysical methodologies, including magnetotellurics (MT). MT is used to determine the electrical resistivity beneath the Earth’s surface to depths of several hundred kilometres, from measuring variations in the Earth’s natural magnetic and electric (or telluric) fields. MT data is valuable to gain better understanding of geologic structures and the movement of the Earth’s crust, because different materials and structures feature different electrical resistivity. As an example, both, the viscosity and electrical resistivity undergo sharp gradients at the interface between the lower lithosphere (the solid rock of the Earth’s crust) and the astherosphere (the Earth’s mantle) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2019.04.012" target="_blank">[4]</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr Selway utilises MT data specifically to run mathematical models for the reconstruction of plate tectonics, climate and biological evolution <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01577-2.pdf?origin=ppub" target="_blank">[5]</a>. Her work in the Arctic and Antarctic supports more accurate measurement of ice loss from polar regions, through improving models of the viscosity of the Earth’s mantle, which controls the rate of isostatic rebound (also see UKANET), a vital factor in determining ice sheet behaviour and predictions of sea-level rise <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander-Minakov-4/publication/340779554_Magnetotelluric_Constraints_on_the_Temperature_Composition_Partial_Melt_Content_and_Viscosity_of_the_Upper_Mantle_Beneath_Svalbard/links/5f7ed767458515b7cf6f57ce/Magnetotelluric-Constraints-on-the-Temperature-Composition-Partial-Melt-Content-and-Viscosity-of-the-Upper-Mantle-Beneath-Svalbard.pdf" target="_blank">[6]</a>. Recordings over several days to weeks are required to obtain data from deep in the mantle. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The expedition is facilitating these measurements by temporarily emplacing magnetotelluric instrumentation on the Forbidden Plateau on the way to Foyn Point, where it will gather data for around two weeks before the team retrieves the equipment on their return journey. </strong>

                <strong>Expedition contribution: </strong>sampling of snow deposition on an event-basis</p>
            <p>
                Prof Michiel van den Broeke’s <a href="https://www.uu.nl/staff/MRvandenBroeke/Profile" target="_blank">profile</a> states <i>‘We measure and model precisely how the climate is affecting the ice caps.’</i> His team utilise a wide range of techniques, including remote sensing, ground-based automated weather stations (AWS) and increasingly sophisticated and detailed computer models to reconstruct, understand and predict past, present and future climate and the mass balance of the large ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. The behaviour of these large ice sheets is important for all of us, as their melting alone would result in a 60 m rise in sea-level. The main processes affecting the dynamics of ice sheets include the balance between snowfall and surface meltwater runoff, accelerated melting beneath the ice sheets, ice flow towards and discharge into the ocean (dynamical mass loss), and the interaction with warming ocean waters on the undersides of floating ice shelves and glacier tongues, as well as the influence of isostatic rebound (see UKANET). However, the accurate projection of sea-level rise is hampered by major uncertainties related to the possibility for major ice sheets to suffer irreversible loss of ice because of the warming climate. The onset of this tipping point is difficult to predict <a href="https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~broek112/home.php_files/Publications_MvdB/2020_Hanna_ESR.pdf" target="_blank">[7]</a> 
            </p>
            <p>
                To reduce the uncertainties associated with model predictions, each of these processes and the parameters that determine their direction and rate of progress merits investment in more observation and data collection. In this context, <i>in situ</i> observations remain essential to validate remote sensing data and to develop, evaluate and improve models of regional climate, ice dynamics and subglacial hydrology. For example, snowfall cannot be determined by remote sensing techniques and few automated weather stations are capable of providing such data. Owing to its hostile climate, with extreme snowfall rates (up to one meter per month), the western Antarctic Peninsula is particularly devoid of observations.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The expedition team will undertake rare and much needed direct measurements of snow deposition rates and record meteorological data during their 34-day trek.</strong>

                The global carbon cycle is important for the Earth’s climate regulation, because carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere is a main contributor to the natural greenhouse effect that ensures temperatures on our planet are hospitable to life as we know it. Before the age of industrialisation, the atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> had been constant at 280 parts per million (ppm) for several thousand years. Since the 18<sup>th</sup> century, it has risen above 400 ppm CO<sub>2</sub>, mainly as a result of fossil fuel burning <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide" target="_blank">[8]</a>. These elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels amplify the natural greenhouse effect, leading to changes in climate and more frequent and severe, extreme weather events.
            </p>
            <p>
                All systems on Earth are linked: atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and biosphere. The oceans, covering 70% of the planet’s surface, are particularly important in climate regulation through absorption of excess heat, regulating temperature through global ocean currents and dissolution of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> in surface waters. There, it becomes the carbon source for phytoplankton, the primary producers that utilise sunlight to photosynthesise and carbon to form their cells structures and multiply. As on land, primary producers are the base of the food web, upon which all other organisms, such as grazers and predators, depend.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Southern Ocean is particularly interesting for climate regulation, having been identified as a major sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-020-0587-0" target="_blank">[9]</a>. The main Antarctic deep water branch of the global ocean circulation system forms in the Weddell Sea, where surface water cools on the continental shelf and sinks. The sinking water ‘exports’ the decay products and faeces of a myriad of organisms into the deep ocean and with it, exports the carbon originally captured by the phytoplankton. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The fresh supply of nutrients, other than carbon, in the Southern Ocean is limited by its remoteness and scarcity of exposed land and river, which, at lower latitudes, provide nutrients to the seas surrounding the continents. As a result, primary producers rely more heavily on nutrients available through recycling within the water column <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12775-5" target="_blank">[10]</a>. The potential scarcity of essential elements, such as iron and manganese, may limit the productivity of the Southern Ocean, and with it, the effectiveness of the carbon pump that supports climate regulation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Weather systems transport air masses and moisture across great distances and entrained with these, particles and nutrients that are deposited on ice sheets, ice shelves and the ocean surface. This atmospheric deposition is an important pathway, by which essential element are transported. As plants on land, phytoplankton require macro-nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorous, and micro-nutrients, including iron, cobalt, nickel and manganese

                The analysis of these samples at the University of Plymouth will provide insights into the magnitude of atmospheric deposition of essential elements, their concentration in melt water and any recent changes that may have occurred. The data will be included in models of processes that influence biomass production. A better understanding of this system will help to improve Earth system models of contemporary climate change and predictions of its future evolution.

            <p>
                In 2004, <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/plymouth-pioneers/professor-richard-thompson" target="_blank">Prof Richard Thompson OBE</a> coined the term ‘microplastic’ with a definition of particles smaller than 5 mm in size. Since then, his research team at the University of Plymouth has won the <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/about-us/the-queens-anniversary-prize" target="_blank">Queen’s Anniversary Prize</a> for Further and Higher Education for their cutting-edge research into the sources, pathways and distribution in the environment and accumulation of microplastics in the food chain. One of Dr Napper’s recent studies revealed the abundance, characteristics and seasonal variations of microplastics in the Ganges river <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749120370378?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">[13]</a>, and another highlighted the impact of tourism on what was once a remote and pristine environment: Mount Everest. Here, microplastic pollution found at altitudes up to 8440m was consistent with the materials used in synthetic clothing and equipment <a href="https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(20)30550-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2590332220305509%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank">[14]</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Microplastic pollution has been reported on all inhabited continents, in the atmosphere and in the sea, from coastal surface waters to the deep ocean. They have been reported in ecosystems and food webs, on our plates and in our glasses <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c01209" target="_blank">[15]</a><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/14/5514" target="_blank">[16]</a>. It is now important to gain a better understanding of the processes microplastics undergo in the environment, and this includes the pathways that lead to their ubiquitous distribution in the remotest areas of the planet. Dr Napper states: “Understanding exactly how far microplastics can travel is the next big scientific question”.

                <strong>Expedition contribution: </strong>deployment of polysulphone ultraviolet dosimetry badges
            </p>
            <p>
                The Earth’s atmosphere is mainly composed of nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>, ~78% by volume), oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>, ~21%) and argon (Ar, ~1%), with relatively constant proportions. Other gases, such as ozone (O<sub>3</sub>, less than 0.000008%) are present in comparatively minute amounts and vary with seasons, latitudes and human activity. The highest ozone concentration occurs naturally in the lower stratosphere, about 7 to 35 km above ground level. It is a very reactive and unstable molecule and as a result, it is formed and destroyed in the lower stratosphere, a process that completely absorbs the highest-energy ultraviolet UVA radiation and blocks most of the harmful UVB radiation from the sun. As such, stratospheric ozone acts as a protective shield against radiation that may harm the biosphere in a variety of ways, from inhibition of photosynthesis in plants and algae to eye and skin damage in mammals 
                <a href="https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/19/12731/2019/" target="_blank">[17]</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The release of synthetic, halogenated, long-lived ozone-depleting substances resulted in the loss of stratospheric ozone, with particularly severe thinning of the ozone layer over polar regions (greater than 60° N and S), commonly termed the ‘ozone hole’. Amidst concerns for human health, especially the increased risk of skin cancers, ozone-depleting substances were successfully banned following the Montreal Protocol in 1987 
                <a href="https://www.unep.org/ozonaction/who-we-are/about-montreal-protocol" target="_blank">[18]</a>. Nevertheless, measuring and modelling total column ozone remains a challenge that is hampered by large uncertainties when evaluating whether or not the ozone layer is recovering <a href="https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/19/12731/2019/" target="_blank">[17]</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the actual impact of trends in total column ozone can be evaluated by measuring the UV radiation dose at the Earth’s surface, and from that, the risk to human health can be assessed. This is particularly important for populations living and working in high latitudes, including scientific staff operating in Antarctica. During the <a href="http://www.bsae2012.co.uk/" target="_blank">Spirit of Scott expedition</a> in 2012, polysulphone ultraviolet dosimetry badges, which absorb UVB radiation, were deployed on sledges hauled across the Antarctic Peninsula. Dr Smedley analysed the badges at the University of Manchester to determine the daily UVB radiation dose at the Earth’s surface, and the results provided valuable complementary data to remote sensing and stationary monitoring equipment <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954102014000790%5bOpens in a new window%5d" target="_blank">[19]</a>. It is of value to his research effort to repeat these measurements to assess changes over time.

            </p>
            <p>
                For those familiar with tardigrades (or waterbears), they capture our imagination as the ultimate resilient organism: they have survived five mass extinction events in Earth’s history and are able to withstand exposure to near-absolute zero temperatures (-273 degrees Celsius), the vacuum of outer space, high doses of ionising radiation, toxic chemicals, and pressures higher than those found in the deepest ocean trenches. Terrestrial and freshwater tardigrades achieve these feats by developing a ‘tun’, whereby the creatures lose up to 97% of their body moisture, slow their metabolic rate to less than 1/10,000 of normal and suspend food and water intake for periods of years, decades or more <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/tardigrades" target=_blank">[20]</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Between 0.5 and 1.2 millimetre in size, with a plump, segmented body and eight clawed legs, their typical habitats are mosses, lichens, and bacterial mats, within which they feed on algae, plant cells, bacteria and smaller invertebrates. Some of the more than 1300 described species occupy soils, dunes or sediments of freshwater and saline waters. Their distribution include all latitudes, the highest mountains and ocean floor thousands of meters below the surface, and in Antarctica they live in the polar deserts and the ice fringes, the 0.3% of the continent not covered in ice <a href="https://nerc.ukri.org/planetearth/stories/1704/" target=_blank">[21]</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tardigrades are one of the most important groups in the challenging ecosystem of the Antarctic continent, on which some 70 species have been recorded. They are key consumers and decomposers, breaking down organic matter and taking part in soil formation, as well as being prey. As a relatively simple organism, they are regarded as biological indicator of environmental change, for example due to the consequences of climate change.
            </p>
            <p>
                Relatively little is known about tardigrade biodiversity and distribution on the Antarctic mainland <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65573-1" target="_blank">[22]</a>. Although the Antarctic Peninsula has the highest biodiversity of the entire continent, tardigrades and associated vegetation, other microscopic animals and bacteria have not yet been studied widely and no data is available for the most of region of the Antarctic Quest 21 expedition. To be able to monitor future change, it is important to obtain baseline data from such remote areas and the expedition provides a rare opportunity to do so. In addition, any samples from areas on the fringe of the ice sheets on the Antarctic Peninsula have the potential to reveal new species of microscopic animals.

                <strong>Expedition contribution:</strong> meteorological observations for NASA citizen science programme
            </p>
            <p>
                Clouds are not just an aspect of our daily weather, they also reflect, absorb and scatter sunlight and infrared emissions from Earth. As such, they prevent direct sunlight reaching and heat the ground and they work as a blanket that reduces the amount of heat, or infrared radiation, that escapes from the ground and lower atmosphere into space. In this way, clouds control the exchange of heat in the atmosphere, and therefore play an important role in regulating the Earth’s climate. Different types of clouds have different effects on this energy regulation and long-term changes in cloud cover and prevalence of certain cloud types can have significant impacts on climate and in turn, changes in climate can have significant impacts on cloud formation. For this reason, accurate and frequent data collection on clouds in all areas of the planet are important for understanding their changes and their impact over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Satellites continuously observe clouds and measure the Earth’s energy balance from space. However, satellites only ‘see’ the top of clouds and are unable to provide information about the cloud base or multiple layers of clouds. Furthermore, some cloud types are difficult to detect and clouds above areas covered in snow can be hard to distinguish from the white ground cover. Observations from the ground made by informed eyes and supported by photographic evidence complement the satellite data by adding valuable detail, enabling researchers to get a more complete picture of clouds in the atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this context, ground observations that are matched to satellite overpasses or geostationary satellites are particularly valuable, as they allow the creation of composite images by an observer on the ground and a satellite looking at the same cloud within a 15-minute time window. The GLOBE Observer: Clouds data requirements include location, overall cloud cover and surface conditions as standard and welcome optional observations of cloud types, cloud opacity, sky conditions and visibility, as well as photos. Data collection is supported by a Citizen Science app, as well as a library of resources that provides tuition, references, videos and book lists.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    The expedition team will make several daily meteorological observations along their route, as well as specifically associated with taking samples and measurements. These data will be shared with the scientific teams associated with the expedition and with the GLOBE Observer: Clouds.
