            <h1 class="black title u-text-center">Phil Carrotte</h1>
            <p>
                Having grown up in mid-Wales Phil has been mountaineering for over 30 years, what began with hill walking in the Brecon Beacons with the Scouts developed into a career in the British Army that included numerous mountaineering expeditions across the globe.  He has instructed safe glacier travel including crevasse rescue to novices, taught people to ski, led multi-day ski touring expeditions, summited numerous 4000 metre Alpine peaks, and also climbed in the Canadian Rockies and Nepalese Himalaya. In 2012 Phil was the logistics officer for the British Services Antarctic Expedition, responsible for sourcing, deploying and recovering equipment and food for the two month 24-strong exploratory ski mountaineering and scientific research expedition; whilst on the ice he ascended seven peaks which are assumed to be previously unclimbed.

            <p>
                During his military career Phil served in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers in the UK and Germany, he deployed on training exercises across Europe, to Canada and the USA, and on operations to Iraq three times.  More recently he spent six months working alongside the United Nations in South Sudan, leading a team of logistics specialists supporting humanitarian construction tasks.  A Chartered Mechanical Engineer with an MSc in Construction Economics and Management, Phil left the Army in March 2021 joining Costain, to whom he is indescribably grateful for their support in his deployment on Antarctic Quest 2021.
